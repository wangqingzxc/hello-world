# hello-world

I am wangqr

One year ago I have signed a Github account but I nearly forgot this account, today I want to restart my tour to Github!

I am a master in Tianjin University majoring in computer science and technology and my favorite coding language is C++. 

You may ask me what am I doing now? I am researching embeded dual-core processor architecture now.
